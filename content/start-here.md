Inspired by [@patio11](https://twitter.com/patio11), I think it’s a good idea for people to keep a list of their best public work. Most of my writing goes into my [personal Substack](https://nihalsahu.substack.com) or [Anticanon](https://anticanon.substack.com) (my law and policy Substack).

### Law and public policy

#### Religious freedom

*   [Inessential practices: charting a non-normative future for Indian religion jurisprudence](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/24730580.2021.1941689) A paper about the philosophical problem of essentialism in the Supreme Court’s essential religious practices test for Article 25. Coauthored with Sheerene Mohammed.
*   [Religious Freedom, Reform, and Secularism](https://nihalsahu.substack.com/p/religious-freedom-reform-and-secularism) An essay about religion and the state in India. I discuss Article 25 of the Indian Constitution and focus in particular on clause 25(2)(b), which allows the Indian state to enact social reforms in ways that contradict sincerely-held religious beliefs. I also discuss the question of whether the reform clause and the right to religious freedom can coexist.

#### Public health

*   [What’s so hard about health spending?](https://nihalsahu.substack.com/p/health-spending) I review Sujatha Rao’s book on India’s health system and write about why government health spending in India stays low.

#### Pharmaceutical regulation

*   [Comments on the Drugs, Medical Devices and Cosmetics Bill, 2022](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/research/comments-on-the-drugs-medical-devices-and-cosmetics-bill-2022/) Submissions to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India; coauthored with Dhvani Mehta and Shreya Shrivastava.
*   [A missed opportunity: New drugs Bill is old medicine in new bottle](https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/a-missed-opportunity-new-drugs-bill-is-old-medicine-in-new-bottle-1149178.html) An op-ed in the Deccan Herald about the missed opportunities in the draft Drugs Bill, 2022.

### The lawyer-brain canon

*   [The Second Best is a Formal Order](https://nihalsahu.substack.com/p/the-second-best-is-a-formal-order) A short response to the death of Queen Elizabeth II, trying to remind people that the rule of law is built on little more than a collective, delusional will.
*   [Tipping the Odds](https://nihalsahu.substack.com/p/tipping-the-odds) A narrative essay on how law and interpretation works in practice, from the perspective of a cab aggregator company trying to evade price regulation.
*   [Against Lawyer Brain](https://nihalsahu.substack.com/p/against-lawyer-brain) I discuss all the ways that the constraints of legal reasoning can make you worse at opinion-formation and decisionmaking, through my personal journey from law into public policy analysis.

### Advice posts

*   [Extremely basic productivity advice](https://nihalsahu.substack.com/p/extremely-basic-productivity-advice) tl;dr; _Do the right things; You have to actually do them; There are also other things._ There’s some advice on focus, picking the right problems, and avoiding distractions here.

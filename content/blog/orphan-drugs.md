In 2013, a boy with the disease Pompe approached the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam, seeking free treatment.  Pompe is a lysosomal storage disorder, a disease that only afflicts around ten persons every year. The treatment for Pompe and many similar diseases is Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT), which is exorbitantly expensive. The estimated annual treatment cost in that case was ₹ 43,00,000, well beyond their means. 
Lysosomal storage disorders are “rare diseases” and ERT is what is known as an “orphan drug”. As the cost of drug development is not offset by a large commercial market, the cost per patient is prohibitively high. 
In any country which provides for some subsidised state healthcare, the government must decide which drugs get a subsidy. This kind of determination is made in the UK, for instance, at the National Health Service, which determines which treatments it will provide by choosing the ones with the lowest cost of adding quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs).

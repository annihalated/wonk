**Rural China.** I’ve been reading Pearl S. Buck’s _[The Good Earth](https://www.amazon.in/Good-Earth-Pearl-S-Buck/dp/147673304X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=10B3660HH6GYX&keywords=the+good+earth&qid=1671407388&sprefix=the+good+ear%2Caps%2C277&sr=8-1)_ (1931) which is about life in a Chinese village in the early 20th century. It’s a book by an American woman who also happens to be the first American woman to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, which is odd because she won it for her ‘rich and truly epic descriptions of peasant life in China.’ And her descriptions are rich and truly epic mainly because Buck grew up in China as the daughter of American missionaries. Here’s Wikipedia:

> The realistic and sympathetic depiction of the farmer Wang Lung and his wife O-Lan helped prepare Americans of the 1930s to consider Chinese as allies in the coming war with Japan

Alrighty then, most books don’t do anything like that. Highly recommended!

**Clinton and Obama staffers**. For those who don’t know, Rahm Emmanuel was a Senior Advisor in the Clinton White House, after being director of the finance committee for Bill Clinton’s 1992 Presidential Campaign. He would later be Chief of Staff to Obama (here’s _The Gatekeeper,_ a [New Yorker profile](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/03/02/the-gatekeeper?utm_source=pocket_reader)) before he left to run for Mayor of Chicago. His role both on the campaign and in the White House is vividly captured in George Stephanopoulos’s memoirs _[All Too Human](https://www.amazon.in/All-Too-Human-George-Stephanopoulos/dp/0316929190/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1AJKGNZRAPOL0&keywords=all+too+human+george+stephanopoulos&qid=1671407370&sprefix=all+too+human+george+stephanopoulo%2Caps%2C279&sr=8-1)_. Here’s an excerpt:

> Our campaign grew fast through the fall. We traded up headquarters, and Wilhelm built up our field organization, working back from Illinois to Florida, where the first symbolic votes would be cast at a straw poll in December. His buddy Rahm Emanuel came down from Chicago to run the money. All I knew about Emanuel at first was that he had once mailed a dead fish to a rival political consultant. But when the former ballet dancer arrived in Little Rock and leaped onto a table to scream his staff into shape, I knew the money side would be OK.”

Anyway, Stephanopoulos is another Clinton staffer; you might remember his name from that _F.R.I.E.N.D.S_ episode ([S1E4, The One with George Stephanopoulos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_with_George_Stephanopoulos)) or his face from _Good Morning America_ and [ABC News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_IR90FthXQ). He was also the basis for Rob Lowe’s [character on The West Wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Seaborn). The memoir is highly recommended too! It’s as gripping and entertaining and deep and thoughtful as pretty much anything I’ve ever read.

**Self-promotion.** Really, my biggest reading recommendation for the week is to read my revamped [website](http://nihalsahu.net). For the moment, I have _shamelessly_ borrowed the same design that Patrick McKenzie uses for [Kalzumeus.com](http://kalzumeus.com), which is basically an old unmaintained Jekyll theme, _[Shiori](https://github.com/ellekasai/shiori)_, that I find so charming. I like the sidebar layout on the posts page, and how the old-fashioned [post layout](https://nihalsahu.net/tipping-the-odds) looks on a big monitor. It’s almost quaint. Yes, yes, I know, it’s pointless when Substack works better for distribution and nobody is going to read my website — I get it. But I like old and charming things, okay? And sometimes I want to write four thousand words and not have it show up in an unnaturally huge font.

**Experiential Recommendations.** I highly recommend walking down Rajpath (or _Kartavya Path_, as it has been renamed, and in the direction towards Rashtrapati Bhavan) while listening to Rainbow Kitten Surprise’s _[Holy War](https://open.spotify.com/track/1zkkvSLk5Nh4uoyKWwuie9?si=837e9b343fe04068)_. I also highly recommend [drinking](https://sidecarindia.com/about-us) with interesting people, especially if one of them happens to be [among your favorite writers](https://twitter.com/annihalated/status/1604199724730699776?s=20&t=wH66Ws_VhXY-1Y-EK-5dBQ).

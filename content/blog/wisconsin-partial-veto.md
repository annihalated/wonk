Since 1930, Wisconsin's constitution has allowed the Governor to veto appropriations bills "in whole or in part": a phrase the Wisconsin Supreme Court has interpreted to mean (with some minor restrictions) that the Governor can strike out individual words in a manner that produces strange results: 
> While constitutional amendments in 1990 and 2008 have constrained this power to prohibit the striking and stringing together of individual letters within words and the creating of a new sentence by combining parts of two or more words across sentences, the Governor can still create policies never intended by the Legislature through a creative cobbling together of words within a sentence.

This is from a 2020 Comment by Alyssa Reloy in the Wisconsin Law Review, charmingly titled "The Cheese Stands Alone" [(link)](https://wlr.law.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1263/2021/10/LeRoy-Final.pdf). 

Yesterday, the Wisconsin Governor did just that:

> ...Gov. Tony Evers struck a hyphen and “20” to change the end date for a $325 per-student spending increase from 2025 to 2425.

Respect. This is from the AP (Wisconsin governor’s 400-year veto angers opponents in state with long history of creative cuts [(link)](https://apnews.com/article/evers-veto-400-years-wisconsin-school-funding-67a7847e4a24ea86f7d16123356f770d)).

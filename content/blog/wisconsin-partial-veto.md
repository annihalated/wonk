Since 1930, Wisconsin's constitution has allowed the Governor to veto appropriations bills "in whole or in part": a phrase the Wisconsin Supreme Court has interpreted to mean (with some minor restrictions) that the Governor can strike out individual words in a manner that produces [strange results](https://apnews.com/article/evers-veto-400-years-wisconsin-school-funding-67a7847e4a24ea86f7d16123356f770d):

> ...Gov. Tony Evers struck a hyphen and “20” to change the end date for a $325 per-student spending increase from 2025 to 2425.

To quote a friend, "that's so goofy hahahaha."

> While constitutional amendments in 1990 and 2008 have constrained this power to prohibit the striking and stringing together of individual letters within words and the creating of a new sentence by combining parts of two or more words across sentences, the Governor can still create policies never intended by the Legislature through a creative cobbling together of words within a sentence.

Everyone knows that a handful of lawyers in India get paid [truly enormous sums of money](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/BvOZE6z7Oyl6LiHZxWVlzL/How-much-do-Delhis-top-advocates-charge.html) per *appearance*. The range of their fees can be anywhere from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 10 Lakh per appearance, or even more. Surely, skill is one reason, but I will bet you that if you listen to arguments at a High Court or the Supreme Court - and have even a modicum of experience with good argumentation - you will be relatively unimpressed. Sure, it's good, but is it good enough for a few lakhs per appearance?

Why are elite senior counsels paid so much? The answer, as always, is structural. The Indian Supreme Court, which currently has 70,000 cases pending before it, only has 34 judges, who sit in panels of two and three. This frankly impossible task is possible (even as a moonshot), because the Court doesn't hear all 70,000 at length. Instead, there's something called an admission day, on which lawyers line up in a fashion more akin to a bazaar than a temple of justice, and try to convince the judge to get the matter admitted for regular hearing.  When you have fifty lawyers trying to sidle up to you and mention individual and complex legal disputes, you are more likely to listen more carefully to lawyers you know and trust.

The famous senior lawyers of India have distinction - they are senior advocates - they even have different outfits, and so if they show up on admissions day, the matter is significantly more likely to be listed. And so, if you want your matter heard quickly, i.e. you want to cut in line, you hire a Senior Counsel, whose face and voice alone merit a hearing. 

This is not a guess - there's data. Tarunabh Khaitan, in his [empirical study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/24730580.2020.1730543) of the Supreme Court's docket, found that:

> the presence of a senior advocate (representing either party) during an admission hearing has a statistically significant, positive, relationship with the likelihood of the case being admitted for a regular hearing; and that it is a bad predictor for the likelihood of eventual success of the case.

Think about lakhs of rupees per appearance. In the surrealist world of Indian courts, you are not paying just for skill and advocacy - you are paying for the chance to have your case heard properly in the first place. Even in regular hearings, courts will bear with senior counsels more, will tolerate wilder arguments, will hear them longer, and will take what they have to say more seriously.

Because they are "stalwarts of the bar." Because they are "the giants of the profession." But they are these things because the judges know them. Because they are friends. Because they grew up in similar environments, and in some cases, [were classmates.](https://theleaflet.in/harish-salve-quits-as-amicus-sc-expresses-displeasure-at-perception-it-wants-to-withdraw-covid-cases-from-high-courts/#:~:text=The%20remarks%20were,S%20A%20Bobde.)

This is not new. Paul D. Clement, the [universally acknowledged god](https://nymag.com/news/features/paul-clement-2012-3/) of the highly-specialised SCOTUS Bar, is paid very highly because the judges like him. Except that at the SCOTUS, one of the reasons the judges like him is because he is *very good*. But personality still does play a part.

The more closed the system, the more nepotistic it is, the higher the returns to familiarity with judges. And Indian law is a system unparalleled for its reliance on power networks, on phone calls, and on friendships.

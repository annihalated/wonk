Restrictions on religious freedom in all shapes and sizes. 

**Direct prohibition.** Let's assume a law which directly banned a religious practice. The provision would read something like: 'No person shall pray to the Cookie Monster.' There aren't really many of these laws around, and they generally cause something of an uproar when they're passed. For example, on February 5th, 2022, the Karnataka Government issued an order barring students from 'wearing a hijab in State educational institutions that had prescribed a dress code' resulting in multiple rounds of litigation, protests, a breakdown of law and order, and general polarisation.

**Neutral rules.** The more common example involves a rule which, without a religious reference, bans some activity that happens to be part of a religious practice. Amanpreet is a Sikh boy in eighth grade and his religion commands that he carry a ceremonial dagger, the kirpan. However, Acme High School has a neutral rule which says "no knives allowed." Amanpreet goes to court and says 'I understand that there is a good reason not to have daggers in the classroom, but my dagger is ceremonial and can't hurt anyone. I claim an exception to this neutral rule, as it does not impose a major burden on you, and because I have a right to my religious practices.' Amanpreet need not even prove that wearing the kirpan is part of his religion, because the Constitution comes right out and says so!

(See Article 25, Explanation I: "The wearing and carrying of kirpans shall be deemed to be included in the profession of the Sikh religion.")

**Facially neutral rules directed at a religious practice.** Let's assume John is a member of the sect (or religious denomination) of Ananda Marg, part of whose practices include performing the Tandava dance. The Tandava dance may look scary to the non-practitioner. It involves holding a dagger in one hand, a human skull in the other, and kicking your legs upward. However, the Commissioner of Police in Calcutta has been repeatedly issuing a Section 144 order, which says that "no member of a procession  or assembly  of five  or more  persons  should carry any  fire arms,  explosives, swords,  spears, knives, tridents, lathis  or any article which may be used as weapon of offence  or any  article likely to cause annoyance to the public, for example, skulls"

When I read the order, I thought I was going crazy. But no, the order really said 'you know, by the way, for example, skulls.’ Oh, very well, then. Either Calcutta had a general 'people walking around with skulls' problem or this facially neutral provision was directed at the Tandava dance. Not very subtle, Mr. Commissioner. 

Now, the Commissioner of Police didn't tell John that the Tandava dance was prohibited. You just couldn't walk around in a group with skulls and knives. The Commissioner instituted a facially neutral prohibition which was nonetheless directed at the religious practice of a particular denomination. John goes to court, and says "Your honour, I am an Ananda Margi, and this practice is part of my religion. The Commissioner’s neutral-seeming rule was directed at my religious denomination’s practices and is discriminatory, and even if that were not the case, I seek enforcement of my fundamental right to practise my religion."
